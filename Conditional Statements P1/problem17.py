# 7. Write a program that asks for an integer and checks if itâ€™s divisible by 2, 3, or both.
num =  int(input(" Enter a number: "))
if num%2 == 0 and num%3 == 0:
    print(f"The {num} number is divisible by both 2 and 3.")
elif num%2 == 0:
    print(f"The {num} number is divisible by 2.")
elif num%3 == 0:
    print(f"The {num} number is divisible by 3.")
else:
    print(f"The {num} number is not divisible by 2 or 3 or .")
